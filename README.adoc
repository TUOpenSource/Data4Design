== Example Web Apps
    
    Example Webapps can be found in the complete and initial directories.

    Current Webapp Development should be done in the webapp directory

== To Run

    From Data4Design/webapp:

        mvn clean package

        java -jar target/webapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
	
	navigate to localhost:8080/ in browser /welcome works too, just the controller

	Will make a bash script that just runs it... maybe make the server dynamic and not from jar file

== Creating Pages

	Two Types of Controllers: 

	Restful Controller: See WelcomeController.java

	JSP Controller: See WelcomeControllerJsp.java
			-- The JSP is in src/main/resources/WEB-INF/jsp
