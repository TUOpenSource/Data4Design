Bootswatch
==========

Bootswatch is a collection of open source themes for [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). Check it out at [bootswatch.com](https://bootswatch.com).

Usage
-----
Download the `bootstrap.min.css` file associated with a theme and replace Bootstrap's default stylesheet. You must still include Bootstrap's JavaScript file to have functional dropdowns, modals, etc.

You can install as a package via npm with the command `npm install bootswatch`.

You can also hotlink the themes via CDN at [BootstrapCDN](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/bootswatch/). 

Lastly, you can import a theme into your styles using SASS.


```sass
@import "bootswatch/theme/variables";
@import "bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
@import "bootswatch/theme/bootswatch";

```


Customization
------
Bootswatch is open source and youâ€™re welcome to modify the themes.

Each theme consists of two SASS files. `_variables.scss`, which is included by default in Bootstrap, allows you to customize the settings. `_bootswatch.scss` introduces more extensive structural changes.

Check out the [Help page](https://bootswatch.com/help/#customization) for more details on building your own theme.

API
-----

A simple API is available for integrating your platform with Bootswatch. More info can be found on the [Help page](https://bootswatch.com/help/#api).

Contributing
-----
It's through your contributions that Bootswatch will continue to improve. You can contribute in several ways.

**Issues:** Provide a detailed report of any bugs you encounter and open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch/issues).

**Documentation:** If you'd like to fix a typo or beef up the docs, you can fork the project, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

**Code:** Make a fix and submit it as a pull request. When making changes, it's important to keep the CSS and SASS versions in sync. To do this, be sure to edit the SASS source files for the particular theme first, then run the  tasks `grunt swatch` to build the CSS.
